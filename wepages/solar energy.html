          Solar energy is a renewable energy source that comes from the sun's radiation. This energy can be harnessed and converted into electricity or used directly for heating.
          The primary technologies for harnessing solar energy include photovoltaic (PV) systems and solar thermal systems.

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Photovoltaic (PV) Systems:</strong><br><br>
            <strong>Solar Cells:</strong> Photovoltaic systems use solar cells to convert sunlight directly into electricity.
            These cells are made of semiconductor materials, such as silicon, which release electrons when exposed to sunlight.<br>
            <strong>Solar Panels:</strong> Solar cells are grouped together in panels or modules,
            and multiple panels are often connected to form a solar array. 
            These arrays can be installed on rooftops, in solar farms, or integrated into various structures.
          </li>
          
          <li>
            <strong>Solar Thermal Systems:</strong> <br><br>
            <strong>Solar Collectors:</strong> Solar thermal systems use sunlight to heat a fluid, such as water or a special heat-transfer fluid, which then produces steam to generate electricity.
            There are two main types of solar thermal collectors: flat-plate collectors and concentrating. <br>
            <strong>Concentrated Solar Power (CSP):</strong> In CSP systems, mirrors or lenses focus sunlight onto a small area, intensifying the sunlight and generating high temperatures. 
            This concentrated heat is used to produce steam that drives a turbine connected to a generator.

            <strong>Key characteristics and advantages of solar energy</strong> <br><br>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Sustainability:</strong><br>
            Solar energy is a sustainable and inexhaustible source of power. 
                  The sun's energy is expected to be available for billions of years.<br>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Clean and Environmentally Friendly:</strong><br>
            Solar power generation produces minimal pollution compared to fossil fuels, 
            contributing to a cleaner environment and reduced greenhouse gas emissions.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Reduced Energy Costs:</strong><br>
            Once installed, solar panels require minimal maintenance, and sunlight is free. 
            This can lead to significant savings on electricity bills over the system's lifespan.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Off-Grid Applications:</strong><br>
            Solar energy is particularly useful in remote or off-grid areas where traditional power sources may be impractical or unavailable. 
            It can provide electricity for lighting, water pumping, and other essential needs.
          </li>
          <li>
            Despite its advantages, solar energy also faces challenges, including intermittency (sunlight availability is not constant), 
            energy storage requirements, and the initial costs of installation. 
            Ongoing research and technological advancements aim to address these challenges and further improve the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of solar energy systems.
