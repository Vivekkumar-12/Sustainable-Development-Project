          Biomass is organic, meaning it is made of material that comes from living organisms, 
          such as plants and animals. The most common biomass materials used for energy are plants, wood, and waste. 
          These are called biomass feedstocks.Biomass contains energy first derived from the sun: Plants absorb the sun’s energy through photosynthesis, 
          and convert carbon dioxide and water into nutrients (carbohydrates).

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Thermal Conversion</strong><br><br>
            <strong>Dam-Based Hydropower</strong><br> 
            Biomass can be burned by thermal conversion and used for energy. Thermal conversion involves heating the biomass feedstock in order to burn, dehydrate, or stabilize it. 
            The most familiar biomass feedstocks for thermal conversion are raw materials such as municipal solid waste (MSW) and scraps from paper or lumber mills.<br>
          </li>
          <li>
            Before biomass can be burned, however, it must be dried. This chemical process is called torrefaction. During torrefaction, 
            biomass is heated to about 200° to 320° Celsius (390° to 610° Fahrenheit). The biomass dries out so completely that it loses the ability to absorb moisture, 
            or rot. It loses about 20 percent of its original mass, but retains 90 percent of its energy. The lost energy and mass can be used to fuel the torrefaction process.
          </li>
          <li>
            During torrefaction, biomass becomes a dry, blackened material. It is then compressed into briquettes. 
            Biomass briquettes are very hydrophobic, meaning they repel water. This makes it possible to store them in moist areas. 
            The briquettes have high energy density and are easy to burn during direct or co-firing.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Types of process by whichBiomass energy is formed</strong> <br><br> 
            <strong>Direct Firing and Co-Firing</strong><br>
            Most briquettes are burned directly. The steam produced during the firing process powers a turbine, which turns a generator and produces electricity. This electricity can be used for manufacturing or to heat buildings.<br>
            Biomass can also be co-fired, or burned with a fossil fuel. Biomass is most often co-fired in coal plants. Co-firing eliminates the need for new factories for processing biomass. Co-firing also eases the demand for coal. This reduces the amount of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases released by burning fossil fuels.<br>
            <strong>Pyrolysis</strong> <br>
            Pyrolysis is a related method of heating biomass. During pyrolysis, biomass is heated to 200° to 300° C (390° to 570° F) without the presence of oxygen. This keeps it from combusting and causes the biomass to be chemically altered.<br>
            Pyrolysis produces a dark liquid called pyrolysis oil, a synthetic gas called syngas, and a solid residue called biochar. All of these components can be used for energy.
            <br>Pyrolysis oil, sometimes called bio-oil or biocrude, is a type of tar. It can be combusted to generate electricity and is also used as a component in other fuels and plastics. Scientists and engineers are studying pyrolysis oil as a possible alternative to petroleum.
            
            <strong>Syngas can be converted into fuel (such as synthetic natural gas). It can also be converted into methane and used as a replacement for natural gas.</strong><br>
            <strong>Gasification</strong><br>
            Biomass can also be directly converted to energy through gasification. During the gasification process, a biomass feedstock (usually MSW) is heated to more than 700° C (1,300° F) with a controlled amount of oxygen. The molecules break down, and produce syngas and slag.<br>
            Despite its challenges, hydropower remains an important and widely used source of renewable energy, contributing significantly to global electricity generation. <br>
            Industrial gasification plants are being built all over the world. Asia and Australia are constructing and operating the most plants, although one of the largest gasification plants in the world is currently under construction in Stockton-on-Tees, England. This plant will eventually be able to convert more than 350,000 tons of MSW into enough energy to power 50,000 homes.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Anaerobic Decomposition</strong><br>
            Anaerobic decomposition is the process where microorganisms, usually bacteria, break down material in the absence of oxygen. Anaerobic decomposition is an important process in landfills, where biomass is crushed and compressed, creating an anaerobic (or oxygen-poor) environment.<br>
            In an anaerobic environment, biomass decays and produces methane, which is a valuable energy source. This methane can replace fossil fuels.
            In addition to landfills, anaerobic decomposition can also be implemented on ranches and livestock farms. Manure and other animal waste can be converted to sustainably meet the energy needs of the farm.<br>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Biofuel</strong><br>
            Biomass is the only renewable energy source that can be converted into liquid biofuels such as ethanol and biodiesel. Biofuel is used to power vehicles, and is being produced by gasification in countries such as Sweden, Austria, and the United States.<br>
            Ethanol is made by fermenting biomass that is high in carbohydrates, such as sugarcane, wheat, or corn. Biodiesel is made from combining ethanol with animal fat, recycled cooking fat, or vegetable oil.
            Biofuels do not operate as efficiently as gasoline. However, they can be blended with gasoline to efficiently power vehicles and machinery, and do not release the emissions associated with fossil fuels.<br>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Biochar</strong><br>
            Biochar, produced during pyrolysis, is valuable in agricultural and environmental use.

            When biomass rots or burns (naturally or by human activity), it releases high amounts of methane and carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. However, when biomass is charred, it sequesters, or stores, its carbon content. When biochar is added back to the soil, it can continue to absorb carbon and form large underground stores of sequestered carbon—carbon sinks—that can lead to negative carbon emissions and healthier soil. <br>
            Biochar is used in Brazil’s Amazon rainforest in a process called slash-and-char. Slash-and-char agriculture replaces slash-and-burn, which temporarily increases the soil nutrients but causes it to lose 97 percent of its carbon content. During slash-and-char, the charred plants (biochar) are returned to the soil, and the soil retains 50 percent of its carbon. This enhances the soil and leads to significantly higher plant growth.<br>
          </li>
          <li><strong>Black Liquor</strong><br><br>
            When wood is processed into paper, it produces a high-energy, toxic substance called black liquor. Until the 1930s, black liquor from paper mills was considered a waste product and dumped into nearby water sources.

            However, black liquor retains more than 50 percent of the wood’s biomass energy. With the invention of the recovery boiler in the 1930s, black liquor could be recycled and used to power the mill. In the United States, paper mills use nearly all their black liquor to run their mills, and the forest industry is one of the most energy-efficient in the nation as a result.<br> <br>
            <strong>Hydrogen Fuel Cells</strong> <br>
            Biomass is rich in hydrogen, which can be chemically extracted and used to generate power and to fuel vehicles. Stationary fuel cells are used to generate electricity in remote locations, such as spacecraft and wilderness areas <br>
            Hydrogen fuel cells may hold even more potential as an alternative energy source for vehicles.Currently, hydrogen fuel cells are used to power buses, forklifts, boats, and submarines, and are being tested on airplanes and other vehicles.
            <br>However, there is a debate as to whether this technology will become sustainable or economically possible. The energy that it takes to isolate, compress, package, and transport the hydrogen does not leave a high quantity of energy for practical use.
